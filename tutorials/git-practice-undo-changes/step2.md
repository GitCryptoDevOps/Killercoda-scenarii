# git reset

If you have added files to the staging area but want to undo this operation, use the `git reset` command.

The files will be moved from the staging area to the working directory.

To reset all files, use `.`.

To reset only certain files, use a space-separated list of files.

To move changes from the staging area to the working directory:

`git reset HEAD .`{{execute}}
