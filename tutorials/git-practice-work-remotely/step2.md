## Git Push

In general, during the development of software, several commits are made. Once the whole thing forms a coherent whole, they are pushed to the remote repository.

To share your commits, use `git push <REMOTE_REPO> <BRANCH_NAME>` :
`git push origin master`{{execute}}

By default, all repositories have a `master` branch.
