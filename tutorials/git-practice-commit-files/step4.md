# git commit

To move files from the staging area to the repository, use the command :

`git commit -m "Creation myfile.txt"`{{execute}}

The time, date, author and a commit message are recorded.

Each commit is given a SHA-1 hash so that it can be referenced later in other commands.

`git status`{{execute}}
